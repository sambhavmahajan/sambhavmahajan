### About Me
Hello! I'm Sambhav Mahajan, a second-year Chandigarh University student studying computer science who has a strong interest in software development. I am presently employed at Outlier AI as an AI Evaluation Specialist, and I have experience with languages including C++, Java, Go, and C#. I've worked on projects like SimpleForums, a web application for forums that uses Spring Boot, NoteApp, a platform for notes that uses ASP.NET Core MVC, and a Go cloud storage service. I wrote a paper "Writing Maintainable Software: A Brief Analysis" and it is accessible as a preprint at TechRxiv and placed second out of over 4,000 participants in Code Forge 2024.
